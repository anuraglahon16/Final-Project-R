# Final Project R
 Hotel booking data set
 
 # 1.	Project Overview:
 
In this project, we will try to predict the possibility of a booking for a hotel based on different factors and also try to predict if they need special requests based on different features. The data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. From it, we can understand the customer’s’ behavior and it might help us make better decisions. 
 
The process of our analysis will be by the following step: Define our Business question, understanding the Datasets, Data preparation and wrangling, analyze the data, model the data, compare model performance, and finally selecting one model.

# 2.	Business Understanding:
My goal for this project is predicting which kind of customers need special request and predicting the possibility of a booking for a hotel by knowing different features. This will help the hotel booking company to make better decisions.

# 3.	Data Understanding:
R library used: fun Modeling, tidyverse, Hmisc, DataExplorer, dplyr, caret, lattice, magrittr, ggplot2, scales, gridExtra, psych, plotly and many more.

The data set contains 119390 rows and 32 columns.
